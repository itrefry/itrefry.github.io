*The Hamilton Experience* is Trefry’s first album, and when conceptualizing it, he was intent on creating a listening experience that took listeners on his journey through his interpretation of the highlights of his college years. The album is structured to take the listener through his experiences chronologically, with the final piece expressing his sentiment about his impending departure from the institution. The first song, “Euphoria,” conveys initial excitement about entering college, reflected in its upbeat tempo and strong beat, which create a sense of constant movement. “Night Out” further amplifies the excitement and thrill of “Euphoria,” reflecting his first experience at a campus party. This piece is both quick-tempoed and thick-textured, with many competing sounds playing at once, intentionally overstimulating by drawing the listener's attention in many directions at once, which best reflects the sensory overload felt at these parties. The sentiment conveyed in “The Winter,” which is slow-tempoed and very bass-heavy, directly juxtaposes with that of “Night Out.” “The Winter” reflects the dreariness of winters in Clinton, NY, with frigid, dark days and a general sense of dread as deadlines for final projects and exams approach. The tone, however, finally lightens with the last piece, “Graduation.” In some ways, this piece parallels “Euphoria,” containing the same tempo and percussive beats, demonstrating that he is still the same person four years after matriculating. Yet, this piece is not identical to the first song, reflecting how he has changed and grown over these four years. The tone in “Graduation” also carries less excitement than “Eurphoria” to illustrate his sorrow about leaving the institution, particularly about missing his friends. Nonetheless, the middle section “Graduation” departs from this sorrowful sentiment through a faster beat, expressing that he knows he still has plenty to look forward to post-graduation, such as living in a new city and starting his career.
